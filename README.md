# Analysis-of-Post-COVID-19-Inflation-in-Ghana
Analysis of post-COVID-19 inflation in Ghana, focusing on the relationship between GDP growth and inflation rates using exploratory data analysis and linear regression modeling. Includes hypothesis testing to determine statistical significance. Implemented in R.

Overview

This project analyzes the rise of inflation in Ghana following the COVID-19 pandemic. It investigates the relationship between inflation rates and GDP growth since 2020, utilizing exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling techniques to derive meaningful insights.
Contents

    Introduction: A summary of the economic context and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on inflation in Ghana.
    Data Preparation: Instructions on how to load, clean, and merge the datasets used in the analysis.

    Hypothesis Testing and Statistical Analysis: Testing the significance of the relationship between GDP growth and inflation rates through linear regression analysis.
    Conclusion: Summary of findings and implications for policymakers.

Requirements

This analysis is implemented in R and requires the following libraries:

    dplyr
    ggplot2
    readr

You can install the necessary packages using the following command:

Usage

    Clone this repository to your local machine:

    bash

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/post_covid_inflation_analysis.git

    Ensure the datasets Ghana Economic Data.csv and Ghana_inflation_rate.csv are in the same directory as your R script.

    Open the R script and run the analysis to explore the data and view the results.

Results

The analysis includes:

    Trends in inflation rates from 1965 to 2023.
    Visual representation of the relationship between GDP growth and inflation.
    Hypothesis testing results indicating whether GDP growth has a significant impact on inflation rates in Ghana.
